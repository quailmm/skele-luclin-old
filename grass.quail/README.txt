Xack's quick Skeleton fix

- This changes the luclin model skeletons to be the classic ones.
- It does cause bugs on some textures in LoY zones, namely bones on the ground will be white.
- It does not affect the newer skeleton with green eyes, e.g. Amulet of Necropotence illusion skeleton.
- Changes your global6_chr.s3d and gequip5.s3d
- Extract this zip to your game folder, it will likely ask you to overwrite files. You may want to consider backing these up.
